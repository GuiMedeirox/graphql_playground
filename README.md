# GraphQL Playground Database

This project provides a PostgreSQL database setup for practicing GraphQL with Docker Compose. It includes a comprehensive schema with sample data that covers common GraphQL patterns like relationships, nested queries, and mutations.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Start the database:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Check if the database is running:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

3. **Connect to the database:**
   ```bash
   # Using psql (if you have PostgreSQL client installed)
   psql -h localhost -p 1395 -U graphql_user -d graphql_playground
   
   # Or connect via Docker
   docker exec -it graphql_postgres psql -U graphql_user -d graphql_playground
   ```

## üìä Database Schema

The database includes the following tables with realistic relationships:

### Core Tables
- **`users`** - User accounts with basic profile information
- **`posts`** - Blog posts/articles with content and metadata
- **`comments`** - Comments on posts (supports nested comments)
- **`categories`** - Post categories (Technology, Travel, Food, etc.)
- **`tags`** - Post tags for better organization
- **`likes`** - User likes on posts

### Junction Tables
- **`post_categories`** - Many-to-many relationship between posts and categories
- **`post_tags`** - Many-to-many relationship between posts and tags

### Views
- **`post_stats`** - Aggregated statistics for posts (comment count, like count, etc.)

## üîó Sample Data

The database comes pre-populated with:

- **5 users** with different usernames and profiles
- **10 posts** across various categories (Technology, Travel, Food, Sports, Music)
- **10 categories** covering different topics
- **10 tags** for post organization
- **13 comments** including nested replies
- **Multiple likes** on posts
- **Relationships** between all entities

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Connection Details

- **Host:** `localhost`
- **Port:** `1395`
- **Database:** `graphql_playground`
- **Username:** `graphql_user`
- **Password:** `graphql_password`

## üìù GraphQL Practice Scenarios

This database setup is perfect for practicing:

### Queries
- Fetch users with their posts
- Get posts with author information
- Retrieve posts by category or tag
- Query comments with nested replies
- Aggregate data (like counts, comment counts)

### Mutations
- Create new users, posts, comments
- Update existing records
- Delete posts and related data
- Like/unlike posts

### Advanced Features
- Pagination
- Filtering by multiple criteria
- Sorting by different fields
- Search functionality
- Real-time subscriptions (if using GraphQL subscriptions)

## üßπ Management Commands

```bash
# Start the database
docker-compose up -d

# Stop the database
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (WARNING: This will delete all data)
docker-compose down -v

# View logs
docker-compose logs postgres

# Restart the database
docker-compose restart postgres

# Reset the database (stop, remove volumes, start fresh)
docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d
```

## üîß Customization

### Adding More Data
You can modify the `init.sql` file to:
- Add more users, posts, or comments
- Create additional categories or tags
- Modify the schema structure

### Environment Variables
You can customize the database setup by modifying the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:
- `POSTGRES_DB` - Database name
- `POSTGRES_USER` - Username
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - Password

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 1395 is already in use, modify the port mapping in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "1396:5432"  # Use port 1396 instead
```

### Permission Issues
If you encounter permission issues, ensure Docker has the necessary permissions to create volumes and access the files.

### Database Not Starting
Check the logs for any errors:
```bash
docker-compose logs postgres
```

## üöÄ Apollo GraphQL Server Setup

This project includes a complete Apollo GraphQL server setup. Here's how to get started:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file based on `env.example`:
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

### 3. Start the GraphQL Server
```bash
# Development mode with hot reload
npm run dev

# Or build and run in production
npm run build
npm start
```

### 4. Access the GraphQL Playground
- **GraphQL Endpoint:** http://localhost:4000/graphql
- **Apollo Studio:** http://localhost:4000/graphql (with enhanced UI)
- **Health Check:** http://localhost:4000/health

## üìù Example Queries

The server includes comprehensive queries and mutations. Check `src/queries.ts` for examples:

### Get All Users with Posts
```graphql
query GetAllUsers {
  users {
    id
    username
    email
    firstName
    lastName
    posts {
      id
      title
      published
    }
  }
}
```

### Get Published Posts with Stats
```graphql
query GetPublishedPosts {
  publishedPosts {
    id
    title
    content
    author {
      username
      firstName
      lastName
    }
    categories {
      name
    }
    tags {
      name
    }
    likeCount
    commentCount
  }
}
```

### Create a New Post
```graphql
mutation CreatePost($title: String!, $content: String!, $authorId: ID!) {
  createPost(title: $title, content: $content, authorId: $authorId, published: true) {
    id
    title
    author {
      username
    }
  }
}
```

## üîß Available Features

- ‚úÖ **Complete CRUD operations** for all entities
